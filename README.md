Week 1 coursework: To refactor existing html and css source code for increased accessibility standards and compliance.
I attempted to increase accessibility by using the correct html semantics to facilitate applications such as video captions.  This included providing alt text for icons and images, renaming various div elements to more specific semantics like header, main, footer, and aside, and reorgainizing each within the code to create a logical progression.  I also removed redundant code with the css, shortening the document significantly without altering or compromising functionality.  I added more specific notes to the html index to indicate what was changed, where, and why.
