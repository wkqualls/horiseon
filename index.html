        Having the image as a background image in CSS kept it from working.
        Stack Overflow recommended against having a background image in the CSS. -->

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

    </main>
    <!--I changed this from "div" to "main" and each "div" within it to "section".
        Because the formatting was uniform, I changed each of the classes in the css to a single "section" class.
        I added alt text for each of the images. -->

        <div>
            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="Lead generation image" />
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="Brand awareness image"/>
            <p>
                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.

            <img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="Cost management image"/>
            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
            </p>
        </div>

    </aside>
    <!--I moved this div within the code and renamed it to "aside".
    I added alt text for eact of the icons.
    I changed the classes within the css to fewer, more uniform classes as above where possible.-->
